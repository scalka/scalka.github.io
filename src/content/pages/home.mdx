# Hej

I'm Sylwia, a Frontend Experience Developer based in the Netherlands, with Polish roots and Irish influence. I'm passionate about crafting meaningful, useful and accessible digital products and experiences.

This website is my [digital garden](/notes/digital-garden/) where I intend to publish all my fleeting thoughts I collect every day. I've been taking notes &rarr; bullet journaling &rarr; zettelkasten-ing in Obsidian since I can remember. I’ve shared my notes with friends and colleagues many times, and now I want to give them their own space..

The topics that keep coming back to me:

- Frontend development as a tool for user experience design
- Making sense of AI without the noise
- Collecting, organising and sharing information
- Connecting the dots between different perspectives to help teams balance quality, speed and purpose
- Collective well-being and kindness towards one another
- Dog training
- Yoga, SUP and other mindful activities
- Gardening and plant care

# Hej

I'm Sylwia, a Frontend Experience Developer based in the Netherlands, with Polish roots and Irish influence. I'm passionate about crafting meaningful, useful and accessible digital products and experiences.

This website is my [digital garden](/notes/digital-garden/) where I intend to publish all my fleeting thoughts I collect every day. I've been taking notes &rarr; bullet journaling &rarr; zettelkasten-ing in Obsidian since I can remember. I had many moments when I wanted to share those notes with others and only now I am ready for it.

The topics that keep coming back to me:

- Collective well-being and kindness to one another
- Frontend Development as a tool for User Experience Design
- Making sense of AI
- Dog training
- Yoga, sup and other activites

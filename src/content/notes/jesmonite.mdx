A few weeks ago, I was looking for an incense holder and found one I really liked. After ordering it, my husband took a look and asked if it was made of Jesmonite. He told me about a YouTuber he follows who creates amazing things with this material. That got me curious, and I immediately wanted to try it myself.

In the end, I invited my girlfriends to join me for a workshop. Here’s what we learned:

Jesmonite is an eco-friendly material that consists of a powder and a liquid, which you mix until it reaches a pancake-like consistency. Our instructors preferred using a bit more liquid than the instructions suggested for better results. It has a strange smell but is safe compared to other materials like epoxy.

Then comes the fun part! You can add colors and mix them slowly to create a marbled effect. Once you like what you see at the top of the cup, pour it into a mold. If you prefer a solid color, keep stirring until it becomes uniform. For more interesting effects, you can pour one color first and then cover it with another. You can even recycle broken pieces by breaking them up, placing them into a mold, and filling the gaps with fresh Jesmonite, kind of like a modern take on [Kintsugi](/notes/kintsugi/).

Before the drying process begins, tap the mold on the sides to get rid of air bubbles, and use a toothpick to pop any on the bottom. Then, you can relax for about 20 minutes while it sets. As it dries, it actually heats up!

Once it’s firm, remove it from the mold, admire your creation, and let it rest for the next 24 hours.

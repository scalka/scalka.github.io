title: 'Stuckness and fonts'

Sometimes, progress is delayed not by major roadblocks, but by small moments of hesitation. These small stumbling blocks don’t seem significant in isolation, yet they quietly disrupt progress. An example could be a personal website project: the notes are written, the technical skills are there and the design foundation exists. Still, seemingly minor decisions, like whether to [study in public](/notes/digital-garden/) or commit to a specific direction, can create unexpected pauses. Even something as specific as choosing typography can become a stopping point, overshadowing broader goals and delaying what could otherwise be a flowing progress.

## Other version of stuckness
At other times, getting stuck is the result of clarity. The vision is sharp, but the exact form it should take doesn’t yet exist. Moving forward means making trade-offs, sacrificing certain aspects in favour of others. In that moment, every option can feel like a loss. As the Dutch saying goes, *kiezen is verliezen*, meaning choosing is losing. The result is often a quiet standstill, caught between wanting everything and committing to nothing.

## Fonts I considered
What does any of this have to do with fonts? Well, that’s exactly where I’m stuck right now: typography. It feels like such a small detail, yet it’s the current bottleneck holding everything else back.

Should I be: 
- Figtree
- Literata
- Spectral
- Inclusive Sans
- or something totally else?

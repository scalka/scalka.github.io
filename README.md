# Flowing Fragments

This website is my digital garden where I intend to publish all my fleeting thoughts I collect every day. I've been taking notes -> bullet journaling -> zettlekasten-ing in Obsidian for years. I had many moments when I wanted to share those notes with others and now is the time.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a digital place, full of ideas, sharing and slow cultivation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A blog, but private and personal.&#xA;A notebook, but public and open.&#xA;A thought, but finally put on digital paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s a space for learning in public.&#xA;A place to follow curiosity.&#xA;A place to get to know me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s a collection of &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/notes/&#34;&gt;Flowing Fragments&lt;/a&gt;: unfinished, unpolished and always in motion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kintsugi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; is the traditional Japanese art of repairing broken pottery. Rather than hiding or discarding what’s broken, the artist highlights the cracks with lacquer mixed with gold, silver, or platinum, highlighting the pottery’s history. The beauty lies in imperfection, the passage of time and impermanence. It’s a metaphor for embracing change and healing from accidental breaks, showing how transformation can lead to something even more beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, progress is delayed not by major roadblocks, but by small moments of hesitation. These small stumbling blocks don’t seem significant in isolation, yet they quietly disrupt progress. An example could be a personal website project: the notes are written, the technical skills are there and the design foundation exists. Still, seemingly minor decisions, like whether to &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/notes/digital-garden/&#34;&gt;study in public&lt;/a&gt; or commit to a specific direction, can create unexpected pauses. Even something as specific as choosing typography can become a stopping point, overshadowing broader goals and delaying what could otherwise be a flowing progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I was looking for an incense holder and found one I really liked. After ordering it, my husband took a look and asked if it was made of Jesmonite. He told me about a YouTuber he follows who creates amazing things with this material. That got me curious, and I immediately wanted to try it myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I invited my girlfriends to join me for a workshop. Here’s what we learned:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is a cheat-sheet for me to see how markdown is rendered with my custom Hugo theme called Oakley (after my dog).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m struggling to find focus for myself at work. In the recent years, the ratio of my content consumption is 9 to 10. I am reading, watching, listening in order to find inspiration for my creative or personal projects. What I noticed that it never brings me any closer to creating any of those creative things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

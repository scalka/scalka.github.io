<dfn>*Kintsugi*</dfn> is the traditional Japanese art of repairing broken pottery. Rather than hiding or discarding what’s broken, the artist highlights the cracks with lacquer mixed with gold, silver, or platinum, highlighting the pottery’s history. The beauty lies in imperfection, the passage of time and impermanence. It’s a metaphor for embracing change and healing from accidental breaks, showing how transformation can lead to something even more beautiful.

Variation on Kintsugi can be applied across various disciplines and materials ex. [using Jesmonite](/notes/jesmonite/).

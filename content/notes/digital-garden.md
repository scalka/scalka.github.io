title: 'Digital Garden'

It’s a digital place, full of ideas, sharing and slow cultivation.

A blog, but private and personal. 
A notebook, but public and open. 
A thought, but finally put on digital paper. 

It’s a space for learning in public.
A place to follow curiosity.
A place to get to know me.

It’s a collection of [Flowing Fragments](/notes/): unfinished, unpolished and always in motion.

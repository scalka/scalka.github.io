I'm struggling to find focus for myself at work. In the recent years, the ratio of my content consumption is 9 to 10. I am reading, watching, listening in order to find inspiration for my creative or personal projects. What I noticed that it never brings me any closer to creating any of those creative things.

I consider myself a person who is creative and has really good ideas. However, recently I am struggling to come up with anything. The raise of GenAI, change in front-end world tend to discourage me from creating something on my own. Who will ever want to read it? Not mention even paying for it. What one need to realise is that it doesn't matter. I am embarking on a journey to find a creative outlet for what's sitting inside. After years of collecting input it's time for me to make something out of it. Will it be a collage, a blog post or just this one note, we will see.
